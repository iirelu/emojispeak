# emojispeak

This is a discord bot with one very small goal, but it does it damn well.
When added to a server, it limits the speech of anyone with a role named
"emojispeaker" to emojis (with the exception of links, mentions, and
actions). You can tell this is a fetish thing, can't you?

## Running yourself

1. [Install rust](https://rustup.rs/)
2. [Generate bot](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and
   add it to your server
3. Set `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable to your bot token
4. `cargo run`

## Adding existing bot

The bot I host myself can be added to your server via [this
link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=451459570993463297&permissions=73728&scope=bot).
I make no promises for how reliable it will be, but I'll try to keep it up
and running for as long as people use it.
